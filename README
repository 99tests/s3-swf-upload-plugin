        :height => 40, 
        :success => 'alert("success");',
        :failed => 'alert("failed");',
        :selected => 'alert("selected");',
        :prefix => 'prefix_in_bucket',
        :upload => 'Press Here To Activate Upload') 
  %>

   In this case, files will be uploaded to http://bucket.s3.amazonasw.com/prefix_in_bucket/filename
